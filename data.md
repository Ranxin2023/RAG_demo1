# On Linghu Chong Reincarnating as a Slime and Presenting the World with a Beautiful Flame Burst

## Chapter 1: Final Tune at Wind Ferry Crossing, A Soul Condenses in Another World
Linghu Chong, the disciple expelled from Huashan and heir to the Sword Demon Dugu Qiubai, lived freely and carelessly through countless martial adventures. After many twists of fate, he believed he could finally retire in peace with Ren Yingying. But fate had other plans. While defending innocent villagers from a mysterious army, he unleashed his formidable Dugu Nine Swords but eventually succumbed to internal injuries. His final thoughts were of the duet he played with Yingying and a nostalgic longing for the mortal world.

When he regained consciousness, everything was strange—no body, no senses, no form—just a gelatinous mass with strange perception. He realized he had become... slime. A lowly, weak monster of legend with no limbs or face—just a core where his soul now resided. Though shocked, he soon adjusted and began exploring his new body.

## Chapter 2: Slime's Rules of Survival and "Star Absorption Technique"
He discovered that slime can absorb and dissolve materials into energy—somewhat like the "Star Absorption Technique." By consuming dead insects, leaves, and glowing stones, he could convert them into nourishing magical energy. The world around him was filled with “mana,” and his powerful soul allowed him to process it far more efficiently than normal slimes. He even sensed energy moving through him like the pathways in the Yi Jin Jing.

One day, deep in a cave, he found a red crystal filled with raging fire mana. Normal slimes would be destroyed by it, but he instinctively knew it could help him. Carefully, he absorbed it.

## Chapter 3: Birth of Flame Burst and the Spirit of Dugu Nine Swords
The fire energy was painful and wild, threatening to tear him apart. But Linghu Chong remembered the "Qi-Breaking Style" of Dugu Nine Swords—use the enemy's force to redirect rather than suppress. He guided the fire energy rather than resisting it, and it gradually obeyed. With enlightenment, he fused sword concepts with mana flow.

He tried releasing the compressed fire energy—a burst of flame exploded on a cave wall. It wasn’t just magic; it was a fusion of Dugu Nine Sword philosophy with slime physiology. He humorously dubbed it the “Bursting Break.”

## Chapter 4: The Booze Bug and First Encounter with Adventurers
Empowered by the new move, he traveled further and encountered wild beasts. With his stealth and burst attack, he survived and grew stronger.

One day he reached a human camp, drawn by the smell of wine. Trying to sip spilled alcohol, he was spotted by a young female mage who found him adorable. Though a swordsman wanted to attack, she protected him.

## Chapter 5: The Slime of Good Intentions
The mage reached out to him gently, and sensing no malice, he let her touch him. Suddenly, frenzied goblins attacked the camp. As adventurers struggled to hold them off, Linghu Chong recalled his chivalrous days and launched a surprise flame burst from the flank, devastating the goblin ranks. It was a stronger, more artistic explosion than before.

## Chapter 6: The Accidental Hero Rises
His fire attack turned the tide of battle. The leader thanked him, and the mage named him “Blaze.” Though unable to speak, he accepted it. Instead of money, he preferred more wine and became an honorary member of the adventurer squad.

Stories of the flame-wielding slime spread—some admired, some feared, some plotted against him.

## Chapter 7: The Black Forest Shadow and Precision Burst
Learning of a cursed forest, he joined the team to investigate. Inside, corrupted wolves attacked. Linghu Chong used Dugu Nine Swords' "Chain-Breaking Style" to disrupt the wolves’ coordination with precision flame needles. The strategy worked, and the team prevailed.

## Chapter 8: Ancient Altar and the Final Style of Sacrifice
Deeper in the forest, they found a dark altar with cultists summoning evil. Linghu Chong realized he must make a final stand. Using all his stored fire mana and life force, he initiated the "Final Style" of Dugu Nine Swords, fusing all energy into a purifying explosion. He became a living firestorm.

## Chapter 9: Beautiful Flame Burst, Cleansing and Rebirth
The resulting blast wasn’t mere destruction—it was purification. Evil energy was dissolved, the forest cleansed, and the cultists obliterated. When light faded, only a glowing slime core remained. The mage held it in tears, nurturing it gently.

He had succeeded. With his understanding of swordsmanship and justice, he had given the world a “beautiful” flame burst.

## Chapter 10: The Legend of the Sword Immortal Slime
Months later, Linghu Chong recovered, his flame more refined and sacred. He continued his travels, still a wine-loving slime who defended the innocent.

He became a legend—“Flame Sage Slime,” even “Sword Immortal Slime”—a being whose flame could purify evil and whose style was sharp like a sword, yet fluid like flame. Whether he returned to human form or not, it didn’t matter. As long as he had his sword, wine, and a heart for justice, slime or human—what difference did it make?

And so, toward the sunset, he hummed a familiar tune as another injustice called for… a beautiful flame burst.
